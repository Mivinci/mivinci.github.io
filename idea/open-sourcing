Open sourcing does not mean making your codes public so others can use them, it never did.

Instead, it means a chance that everyone can access and help.

Open sourcing is a way of struggling in this ridiculous world that the idealists are using to reach their wishes. All the ideas shared through opening sources more or less contribute to a brighter and more diversed world.

To open source is to build up trust between you and the world. The project you build can be understood and trusted by people who see them and you must believe that what you have made can grow the second you made it open, with every issue being fixed and every proposal being handled.

Open sourcing makes you think and reflect on what you are doing and what you have probably missed.

Open sourcing is not just a software thing. It is about opening up minds. It is a rule breaking play that everyone on this planet deserves trying. 

In all, open sourcing is a right approach to create a place that worth living.
